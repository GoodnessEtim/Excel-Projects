# Infant Weight Patterns Across Gender and Parity Groups

This project analyzes how infant weight varies based on gender and the number of siblings (parity). A dashboard was created in Excel to visualize insights from the dataset.

## Dataset Used

The data set includes 550 infants of which 192 have one sibling, 180 has no siblings, 116 have two siblings and 62 have three or more siblings. 

### Process
- Created pivot tables to examine average infant weight across gender and parity groups
- Used bar and combo charts to visualize trends and comparisons

#### Dashboard Design 

- Combined charts and key metrics into an Excel dashboard
- Added clear titles and insight summaries to enhance clarity.

##### Key Insights

- Infants with no siblings had the **lowest average weight**.
- **Weight slightly increases** as the number of siblings increases.

#### Final Conclusion

There is a modest trend indicating that parity may influence infant weight. Gender-based differences are present but less pronounced.
